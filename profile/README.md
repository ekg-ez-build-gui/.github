Native it runs only in Windows for now, the focus is be multiplataform (to supports native systems as Android and Linux).

You can read the docs of EKG api here!

Metas:
- Awesome performance.
- Easy to build context GUIs.

The project is not initial, EKG had an old source written for Android (NDK) but the code and performance was not too good.
